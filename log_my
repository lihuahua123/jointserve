The panel will be involved in all phases of the competency framework development as they will review findings from the scoping review and focus groups. \n\nFocus group with mental health clinicians \n Mental health clinicians (i.e., psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, youth outreach workers and nurse practitioners) will be invited to join focus groups to review youth narratives and discuss how they would address the needs of the Black youth involved. The youth narratives will be generated through collecting stories from social media and through an online survey. The survey will ask about young people's experiences with mental health conditions, their use of mental health services, and their suggestions for how to improve mental health care for young people. The online survey will collect stories anonymously. Anyone who submits a story through the survey will be redirected to a list of resources. The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by thematic analysis. The focus groups will continue until thematic saturation.\n\nPhase 3: Persona Scenario method with Black youth\n Black youth will be invited to focus groups (or one-on-one interviews, if requested) using persona scenario methods. The findings from the focus groups with mental health clinicians will be used to create clinician personas, including information about their motivations, challenges and describe the different ways in which the clinician might interact with the Black youth based on youth narratives. Black youth will be asked to share their perspectives and preferred clinician responses. The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

The Before-After-Bridge copywriting framework is designed to highlight the transformation that a person can experience after using a product or service.\n\nThe reason why these two frameworks work well together is that they both focus on transformation and growth. By combining them, you can create a powerful narrative that speaks to your audience's desire for personal development and improvement.\n\nFor example, imagine you are selling a personal development course that helps people overcome self-doubt and build self-confidence. By using the Coming of Age archetype, you can frame the course as a journey of self-discovery, where the customer will face challenges and obstacles, but ultimately emerge as a more confident and self-assured person.\n\nThen, by using the Before-After-Bridge framework, you can show the customer what their life will be like after completing the course. You can highlight the benefits of increased self-confidence, such as improved relationships, better career opportunities, and greater overall happiness. By painting this picture of what's possible, you can create a sense of excitement and motivation that encourages the customer to take action and enroll in the course.\n\nOverall, the Coming of Age story archetype and the Before-After-Bridge copywriting framework work well together because they tap into a fundamental human desire for growth and transformation.

It’s more like walking into a store and placing\nan order than like telling a friend about your day. This chapter focuses on establishing\nachievable goals within a particular context. Of course, the business context\nin which you are pursuing your goals is shaped importantly by less formal communications\nincluding social interactions with subordinates, peers, superiors, customers,\nand many others.\nIt’s relatively easy to execute most communication tasks. Unfortunately, managers\ninvariably face many communication decisions simultaneously. The right decision\non one task often involves the wrong decision on another. Superiors have\nconflicting, hidden, or counterproductive demands. Subordinates’ requests are\nsometimes unreasonable or incompatible. Importance\nOnce you’ve sorted out your goals, you’ll typically find that several are of high priority\nand that some of these are in direct conflict. The urgency test may help here.\nSome very important situations can wait a day, a week, or a month to resolve, while\nothers can present a now-or-never opportunity. Sometimes less immediately obvious\ngoals, such as establishing your credibility with coworkers, can be more important\nin the long run than getting a specific proposal approved.\n\nTo summarize: The very definition of management turns on determining\nlong-term goals and setting the processes in motion to achieve them. Time constraints\nrequire that you do some things and postpone others. Any successful\nmanager will be deluged with requests to do more than is humanly possible.\nOften, you’ll have to say “no,” or “later.” If you can explain these responses in understandable\nterms, you’ll gain credit from your various audiences and earn the\ntime to make informed decisions.\nPut yourself in the position of the protagonist in the following case, define your\nbusiness goals, derive your key communication goals, and then ask yourself, What\nwould I write? What would I say? While this case predates the age of the Internet,\nconsider whether\nGoals must be tested immediately against the context in which you’re trying to\nachieve them. That context includes your personal position within the organization,\nthe available resources, the organization’s traditions and values, networks of personal\nrelationships, the interests and biases of superiors, communication channels,\nthe situation of your business vis-à-vis that of competitors, how your area fits into\nthe larger organization, and even the general cultural climate.\nTest each of your goals against the context by asking a few key questions:\n1. Are my goals ethically sound?\n2. Am I a credible source for this direction or proposal?\n3. Are adequate resources available to achieve my purpose?\n4. Will my goals enlist the support of others whose cooperation I need?\n5. Do they conflict with other goals of equal or greater importance?\n6. Do they stand a reasonable chance, given the internal and external competitive\nenvironment?\n7. What will be the consequences of success? Overall, will I and my organization\nbe better off after achieving these goals?\nThese tests may cause you to conclude that either your goals need to be modified\nor other goals that you hadn’t considered at first may be more important than those you\nhad identified initially.\n\nAre you ready for text 2?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ''}]

Mobile tariffs have can have between one and 5 sim cards. Each booked sim cards enables the user to optionally book a smartphone for that card. Depending on the tariff, the chosen smartphones (if any) and the kind of sim cards (adult, child) the price will adapt.
